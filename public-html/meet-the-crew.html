                hunting and fishing and this love for the outdoors led to him founding GGT Outdoors. Some of Parker’s
                favorite things about hunting is spending time with family and friends, enjoying God’s creation, and of
                course chasing anything from screaming bulls to rutting bucks and even to gobbling turkeys. When Parker
                isn’t hunting or preparing for hunting season you will probably find him with some sort of fishing pole
                or getting ready to go camping with some buddies. Parker especially loves sitting by the fire in the
                evenings listening to stories about the adventures the others have had that day.

                age. Growing on the west bank of the muddy Gila river across from the small town of Kearny AZ on a small
                Farm/Ranch. At the age of 12 his mom bought him the 1st Quad Runner by Suzuki and he learned the
                backroads of the desert by Kearny like the back of his hand. At 15 he went on his 1st Big game hunt with
                his friend Curtis and Eddie Stacy. He and a friend bagged a couple of bucks the first year they went
                hunting, and that was the start of his lifelong love for Hunting.

                As an adult he has also come to love fishing as well, but Hunting is what He likes the most. He has
                refined his hunting skills, from learning how to glass for animals to learning to be patient in a blind
                he has a passion for hunting. Now one of his favorite things to do is to spend quality time in God's
                creation enjoying the company of his Family and Friends.
