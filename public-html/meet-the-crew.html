Some of Parker’s favorite things about hunting is spending time with family and friends, enjoying God’s creation, and of course chasing anything from screaming bulls to rutting bucks and even to gobbling turkeys. When Parker isn’t hunting or preparing for hunting season you will probably find him with some sort of fishing pole or getting ready to go camping with some buddies. Parker especially loves sitting by the fire in the evenings listening to stories about the adventures the others have had that day. #godsgotthis<br /><br /></span>
